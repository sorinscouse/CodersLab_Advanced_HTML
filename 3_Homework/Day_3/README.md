## Day 3

### Exercise 1. Simple page

Create a page just as the one you see below:

![Website](images/site.jpg)

* Start by resetting all browser-specific CSS properties (a simple reset is enough).
* Add the [Bungee Inline](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Inline) font to the page. Connect the font family directly from Google Fonts.
* Add 3 elements to the body:
    * ```header```
    * ```section```
    * ```footer```
* Create a __container__ class. Set its width to ```800px``` and make it always centered horizontally.
* Set ```header``` width to ```100%``` and height to ```700px```. Use __concert.jpg__ from the __images__ catalog as background.
* Make the ```header``` background always centered and stretched to cover the whole element (use appropriate ```background-size``` and ```background-position``` values).
* Place some text within the ```header``` (use an appropriate semantic element), center it vertically and horizontally in relation to its parent, and give it the following properties:
    * font weight: ```700```,
    * font size: ```50px```,
    * font color: ```#FFFFFF```
* Set ```section``` width to ```100%```, height to ```350px```, and background color to ```#FFFFFF```.
* In __text.txt__ in the __Day_3__ catalog, there is text to be placed inside the ```section``` element.
* Remember that the text in the ```section``` element must be limited by an appropriate element with __containter__ class.
* Move the text from the top by ```100px``` and give it the following properties:
    * font weight: ```400```,
    * font size: ```22px```,
    * line height: ```26px```
* Set ```footer``` width to ```100%```, height to ```200px```,  and background color to ```#000000```.
* The text in the ```footer``` is centered vertically and moved as far to the right as possible (remember that it is limited by the element with __container__ class).
* The text in the ```footer``` has the following properties:
    * font weight: ```400```,
    * font size: ```20px```,
    * font color: ```#FFFFFF```.
