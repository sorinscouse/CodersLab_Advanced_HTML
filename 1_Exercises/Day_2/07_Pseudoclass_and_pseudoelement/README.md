> Do the exercises in the ```index.html``` and ```css/style.css``` files.
> For the exercise done with the lecturer, use `navigation.html` and `css/navigation.css`

## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Navigation (~10min - 15min)

In **navigation.html** and **navigation.css** there is navigation prepared. Add the following functionalities:

* After hovering over the navigation element, change the background of this element to #E3E3E3
* The current list has a problem - it is not completely centered. This is due to the margin set on each item of the list. Fix the bug in such a way that the list is perfectly in the middle (use **:last-child**)
* Each element of the list should have its ornament (overturned 5x5px black square).

The final result:
