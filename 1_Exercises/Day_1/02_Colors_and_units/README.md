## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1. Units (~ 7min - 9min)
Write a couple of words in both elements. Test how **rem**, **em** and **px** units work on the text you added. What differences can you see? Describe your observations in a comment (in **style.css**).


### Exercise 2. Inheriting (~ 5min - 7min)
Return to the first **div** in the exercise done with the lecturer. Changes its width and height to ```300px```. How did the **div** with the gray background change? What differences can you see? Describe your observations in a comment (in **style.css**).
