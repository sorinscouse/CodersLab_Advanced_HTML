## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Adding a font family to the project (~ 8min - 10min)

Add any text to the **index.html** file and set a font for it generated on the page [fontsquirrel.com](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator).

Follow the steps below:
*  Go to [google.com/fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) and find **Lato** font family.
*  Choose this font. A new window with additional options will appear. In the top right corner, there is a button that allows you to download the files. Download them.
*  When it has downloaded, extract the files from the archive. Notice the number of files. Why are there so many of them?
*  Go to [fontsquirrel.com](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator).
*  Click the **Upload fonts** button.
*  On your computer choose the **Lato-Regular.ttf** file.
*  Confirm that the font comes from a legal source.
*  Click the **Download your Kit** button, wait a moment, download the archive and extract it.
*  In the project catalog, add a new catalog named ```fonts```. Place all font files in it (notice the file extensions in the archive).
*  Open ```style.css``` and copy the code linking the font from ```stylesheet.css```: ```@font-face```. Set appropriate paths to the font directory:
	* ```../``` &ndash; exiting the catalog,  
	* ```/fonts``` &ndash; entering the ```fonts``` catalog,
*  Test in your browser/browsers if the font was added correctly.
